# LeagueOfLanguage
LeagueOfLanguage is a stack-based esoteric programming language inspired by different champions on the Summoner's Rift

## Getting Started
To run LeagueOfLanguage programs, you'll need the LeagueOfLanguageInterpreter. This interpreter reads .rift files containing LeagueOfLanguage instructions and executes them.

## Instructions
- `NUNU`: Push 0 onto the stack.
- `YUUMI`: Add 1 to the top value of the stack.
- `ZAC`: Pops A and then B from the stack and pushes B * A to the stack.
- `THRESH`: Takes one integer of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `BLITZCRANK`: Takes one character of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `ALISTAR`: Takes a string of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `BLITZCRANK`: Takes one character of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `POPPY`: Pop the top value of the stack and print it as an ASCII character.
- `HEIMER`: Pop the top value of the stack and print it as an integer.
- `ANNIE`: Pops and prints the top value of the stack as long as it is not empty.
- `KLED`: Checks if the stack size is equal to two, then pops the top stack which is an integer it stores in `count`, then it pops the top of the stack again which is a character it stores in `chaValuer`, then prints `charValue` `count` number of times
- `KAYN`: Reverses the entire stack
- `PYKE`: Terminate program execution.
