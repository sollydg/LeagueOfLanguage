# LeagueOfLanguage
LeagueOfLanguage is a stack-based esoteric programming language inspired by different champions on the Summoner's Rift

## Getting Started
To run LeagueOfLanguage programs, you'll need the LeagueOfLanguageInterpreter. This interpreter reads .rift files containing LeagueOfLanguage instructions and executes them.

## Instructions
- `NUNU`: Push 0 onto the stack.
- `YUUMI`: Add 1 to the top value of the stack.
- `ZAC`: Pops A and then B from the stack and pushes B * A to the stack.
- `THRESH`: Takes one integer of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `BLITZCRANK`: Takes one character of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `ALISTAR`: Takes a string of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `BLITZCRANK`: Takes one character of input and pushes its ASCII code to the stack.
- `POPPY`: Pop the top value of the stack and print it as an ASCII character.
- `HEIMER`: Pop the top value of the stack and print it as an integer.
- `ANNIE`: Pops and prints the stack one value at a time
- `KLED`: Pops the top of the stack (n) and then pops the stack again (x) and prints x n times
- `KAYN`: Reverses the entire stack
- `PYKE`: Terminate program execution.
